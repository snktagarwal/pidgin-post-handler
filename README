This is just a POC to handle GET request.

INSTALL
======

The website is embedded with the APP, so you can simply download it and:

* Set the appropriate settings for DB at settings.py
* python manage.py syncdb
* python manage.py runserver 8000

And you should be good to go.

DEMO
====

Goto: http://localhost:8000/collectstats/ to see the default page
Goto: http://localhost:8000/collectstats/collect/?uname=xx&im_service=xx
to see how GET requests are handled on the server.

ADMIN
====

The admin interface is handled at /admin/, you can see the various database
being populated. In particular look for UserStatSub table.
